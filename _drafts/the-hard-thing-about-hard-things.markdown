title: The Hard Thing About Hard Things
---

I recently read Ben Horowitz's book [The Hard Thing About Hard Things](), and it offered a lot of insights.

The first thing I took away was actually quite simple: if you launch a company and you are the CEO, <u>prepare</u> yourself for hardship and do not be surprised at the stress. That being said, have <u>courage</u> and <u>confidence</u> to go with your best decisions even when others disagree.  You are the leader, and your decision is the one that stands, so do not be afraid.

The second idea I took away is Ben's idea of 2 types of leaders.  Type 1 is someone who focuses on <u>innovation</u> and exploring, creating something out of nothing -- most startup leaders are this type.  Type 2 focuses on <u>process</u>, meaning increasing efficiency, so this type may be seen leading large, established companies.  Ben recommends that a company have both kinds of people, since type 1 people typically lack the skills that a type 2 person can bring into the organization, and vice versa.

However, this idea gave me insight into the kinds of bosses I've had over the years, and who I work best with and who I tend to have conflict with.  I am clearly a type 1 (ask my mother!), and so my strengths are in brainstorming, problem solving, and doing something new.  I can manage projects and people, but the details of naming-conventions, certain kinds of documentation, or complex JIRA ticket management bore me to tears.

From the other perspective, these process details greatly excite some of my past managers.  They love meetings, project-planning spreadsheets, arguing over the best name for a variable or a spreadsheet column header, and all sorts of mundane details.

Now, I <u>do</u> see the value in these type 2 behaviors -- they make an organization run efficiently and help communication and decision-making in larger organizations -- but this is frequently a source of conflict.  Large organizations typically have a large number of "middle managers".  These people are solidly type 2.  They spend their time arguing, typically about "who does what", so as to never have unreasonable expectations for their team.  At a certain point, their presence (and salaries) are going to be only a drain on the system and will not be contributing.

It's difficult to know whether someone is necessarily a type 1 or 2 in a job interview, and of course I would hire both types (some of my best reports have been type 2), but the question is: what is the best ratio of 1s to 2s, and where do you put the 2s in a larger organization?

Ideally the type 2s would be near the top, but not at the very top, say, SVP-level reporting to C-level execs.  It's important for type 1s to set the vision.

At my current day job, I am at the top of my layer directly below a vast layer of type 2s.  I do not expect to be promoted to this layer, nor do I want to, because process-stuff bores me.  It's partly for that reason that I will eventually need to change jobs, to leap-frog over middle management directly to some kind of upper management (or startup founder).
