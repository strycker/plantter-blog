title: The Power of Limits
---

The New Yorker had a very interesting [article](http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/social-media-affect-math-dunbar-number-friendships) in 2014 by Maria Konnikova about [Dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number), a proposed limit to the number of relationships one can realistically maintain.

Dunbar's research suggests most people have only 5 truly close friends, 15 friends for sympathy, 50 for dinner party friends, and only 150 max.

I'm thinking that enforcing LIMITS in planTTer might actually HELP people - just like Twitter's original 140 character limit actually forced people to be terse and creative.

If we limit the max number or contacts to 100 and then allow backups somewhere, users can view the predicted "friend-rank" from the app (based on number of interactions, rating of interaction, etc) and then manually sort their friends into appropriate circles automatically.

Could make prioritizing certain relationships easier, cut down on the number of reminders/notifications, and make event planning easier (invite  my top N friends)

A similar idea I had earlier is for invites to only have the options of RSVPing yes or no... "maybe" will NOT be an option!  We need to help our generation learn commitment and loyalty instead of always "keeping our options open", which has the hidden cost of lowering intimacy.

The bottom line is that imposing restrictions can help people make the cuts they want to make but are too busy or feel socially awkward cutting people off.  What do you all think?  Any other ideas for positive restrictions?!
