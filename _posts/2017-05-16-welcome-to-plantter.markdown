### What is planTTer?
<br>Right now planTTer is just a few ideas in my head, loosely tied together to accomplish a single purpose: to help people make their EXISTING communities stronger and healthier.

Ever been a part of a book club or religious small group that never gelled, and fizzled out after a few weeks?  How about friendships that once were strong, but now you rarely communicate?

Life happens to us all -- but what if having strong circles of friends was a given?

planTTer won't be a social network for reconnecting with high school classmates, or a way to find a new club, or a dating site, or an event planning app.  Then again, it may end up being all of those things.  I am designing a platform that will help users organize their social lives in such a way that they can have MORE time with people - in real life.

Before I start seriously planning, designing, building, coding, and testing this platform, I first need to evaluate what problems people have forming community, what causes groups of friends to disperse over time, and what prevents people from participating in the events around them.

If you have ideas, problems, solutions, or general experience you can share with me to help this endeavor, send me your thoughts by emailing [glenn@plantter.net](mailto:glenn@plantter.net)
