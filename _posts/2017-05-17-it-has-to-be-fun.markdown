Last night I pitched my early ideas for planTTer to my good friend Joe, who also happens to co-lead a small group with me and another friend.

Joe liked the overall mission, and saw the potential for a service that reminds users of lapsed friendships and makes it easier to find compatible schedules for meeting up.

Then I told him about how I want planTTer to also be for GROUPS, and my girlfriend's ideas for gamifing the application -- for example, users could get points for participating, redeemable for coupons or deals at the venues they use for their planned outings.  We could offer check-ins that verify that groups actually met, and record stats for who participates the most.  planTTer would be more than just a productivity app.

Joe really liked these gamification ideas and got even more excited about our project.  He said that these last ideas made planTTer sound FUN, and predicted that people will ultimately use our platform only if they ENJOY it, not simply because it might make their lives marginally easier.

Making social event coordination easier is still important for planTTer, but to ultimately succeed, IT HAS TO BE FUN.

I really like this statement, and plan to make it a mantra for the rest of the design process!

However, deciding whether or not something is fun may be difficult to answer in practice.  Some proposed features (say, earning "badges" for participation) may be attractive to some users, but annoying for others.  "Fun" might look very different for Grandma compared to a 14-year-old (then again, teenagers and retirees might have more similarities than busy 30-somethings).

This is why I need ideas and feedback from as many early adopters as possible, and for these users to be diverse in every way.  I need to know what features are fun across the board, and which are fun for only a segment of participants.  And for those such features, we'll need to decide what to cut vs make optional in a configuration menu.

Regardless, I am very inspired by this new lens through which to view my project.  The mantra "keep it fun" will be a helpful perspective for designing a useful service that people will actually ENJOY using.
