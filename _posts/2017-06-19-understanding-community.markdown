As important as it is to have an excellent product and carefully planned business model in order to create a company, I realized last week that it is more important for me to understand the problem I am attempting to solve at a philosophical level.  So, I am pausing my reading of business books and startup advice in order to better understand COMMUNITY, especially topics such as

* Why do humans need family?  Friends?  Community?  What is the purpose of groups?
* What are definitions of community, and examples for each?
* Are families communities, or is a "family" a fundamentally different type of group?
* What makes a healthy community?
* Why do some communities grow, and others shrink, split, or die?
* What barriers are there to forming community?
* What aids or prevents groups from "gelling"?
* What has changed communities (for better or worse) in the USA in the past decades?
* What effect does technology play in forming or fracturing communities?
* How do we best interact within a community?
* How are successful communities led?  How is leadership taken or assigned?
* How are "communities of communities" organized and led, e.g. small groups within an institution?
* How can we best use technologies to form and nurture communities?
* How can we instill the sense of love, purpose, and belonging for individuals living in the 21st century?

In order to better understand communities, I bought the following sociology and leadership books:

* [Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743203046) by Robert D. Putnam
* [Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465031463) by Sherry Turkle
* [The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character, and Achievement](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812979370) by David Brooks
* [Successful Small Groups: From Concept to Practice](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0834123371) by Teena M. Stewart
* [Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591842336) by  Seth Godin**
* [Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455566381) by Sebastian Junger**
* [Tribes : A New Way of Learning and Being Together](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0932762409) by Jeanne Gibbs**

<small>**It is notable how the use of the word "tribes" to describe groups has been trending lately.  It seems this concept is resonating with people &#8211; tribal behaviors are influencing politics, social behaviors, and community.  If we can understand "tribes" at planTTer &#8211; how to form a new tribe, create a group identity, create loyalty and family-like interactions, and give people back purpose and sense-of-belonging &#8211; then we can better foster community and make planTTer a success.</small>

In the weeks ahead, I hope to read these books and review them on this blog.  I hope answer some of the questions I posed, although I'm sure as I research I will begin to have more questions than answers!
