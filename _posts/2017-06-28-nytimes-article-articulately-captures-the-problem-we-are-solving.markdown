Recently I came across this article from 5 years ago in the New York Times that laments how difficult it is for 30-somethings and older to make friends.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Friends of a Certain Age &#8211; Why Is It Hard to Make Friends Over 30?](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html)

Some highlights from this article:

* Adults have many "friends" and connections on social networks, but fewer close friends
<br><br>
* As people move into new life-stages after college, they tend to consolidate their friendships into fewer-but-deeper friendships, and form fewer new friendships
<br><br>
* "Life gets in the way" &#8211; after their 20s, people are busier with their work and family lives and have less time and energy to spend with friends
<br><br>
* Friendships can form from seemingly mundane commonalities
    * Randomly assigned college roommates, dormmates, classmates, etc.
    * Parents whose kids are friends
<br><br>
* Forming friendships as couples is more difficult than for singles
    * there are 4 different interactions to manage instead of 1 &#8211; does everyone like everyone else?
    * kids and work schedules for 4 people make scheduling events more difficult
<br><br>
* To become strong, friendships require 3 main things:
    * proximity
    * repeated, unplanned interactions
    * a setting that encourages people to let their guard down and confide in each other
<br>

These observations are directly related to the problems that we are trying to solve at planTTer. &nbsp;Young adults in particular are finding it difficult to have meaningful community and relationships, in part because the 3 requirements for close friends are not being met. &nbsp;planTTer's goal is to meet these requirements, and coach users to be better friends themselves.

To address "proximity", we intend to focus on local friendships.  &nbsp;planTTer isn't going to recommend or find friends (there are plenty of apps that already do this), but once local friends are made, planTTer will help them grow.

We will do this by fostering "repeated interactions" by reminding users to connect and helping them schedule activities. &nbsp;"Unplanned interactions" are, by definition, unplanned, so we can't help with that!  However, by fostering community and helping groups gel, these unplanned interactions will occur organically as the group spends time together.

Finally, to foster "settings that encourage people to let their guard down", we will suggest activities and venues designed to be good for groups and 1x1 friendships. &nbsp;We will actively coach users in how to lead their groups, and be better friends themselves.  Friendship and belonging are skills that are being lost, and planTTer wants to help people gain these disciplines back through planning, reminders, scheduling, organizing, and incentivizing good behavior.

Friendships and community involve intentionality, planning, communication, and vulnerability.  planTTer will address these needs with our platform!
