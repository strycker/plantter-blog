He's been married for 5 years and has 2 kids: a 3-year-old and an infant at home.  Peter lives in Chicago and considers himself to have many friends, but finds it difficult to get out much.  His friends are in a similar life stage and it's difficult to schedule time for meeting together.  His wife, Vanessa, is in a similar position with her friends.  As a couple, they find it even more difficult to find other couples as friends, because there are too many schedules to coordinate and people to please.  They spend most evenings at home or alone, and wish they had better relationships outside of their family.\n\nOr meet Susan.  She's 28, single, and just moved to a new city.  She's attempted to make new friends through club website and apps, and also has tried her luck with online dating.  Susan has met a few nice people at these events and dates, but no one is part of a group she could join.  She's frequently lonely, and frustrated that her attempts to make friends haven't panned out.\n\nPeter and Susan are really me (Glenn) of course, or my best friends David and Todd, my cousin Erich, my friends Joe, Preston, and Matt... or my girlfriend and her friends... or a lot of other older-Millennials (if you want to call us that).  Not all of us are married or have kids, but all of us are finding it difficult to make friends a priority.  We aren't bad people or bad friends... just busy.

His friends are in a similar life stage and it's difficult to schedule time for meeting together.  His wife, Vanessa, is in a similar position with her friends.
